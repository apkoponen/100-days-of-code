# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up a Landing Page with ConvertKit
- Started the project with Create React App with Tailwind CSS
- Read Refactoring UI and studied Gerrit UI for design

**Thoughts:**
- Using ConvertKit was easier than expected. Especially setting up custom domain was surprisingly painless.
- Setting up React development environment with TypeScript was a breeze!
- This tutorial for using Tailwind CSS was super valuable https://blog.logrocket.com/create-react-app-and-tailwindcss/.
- Designing the UI is likely going to be a PITA for me, but that only means that I'll learn a ton of new stuff! :P
